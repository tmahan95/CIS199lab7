Create and test an application that solves the following problem: The Whippet Bus Company charges prices for tickets based on distance traveled, as shown in the accompanying table.

Whippet Bus Co. Ticket Pricing
Distance (miles)	Ticket Price ($)
0 - 99	25.00
100 - 299	40.00
300 - 499	55.00
500 and farther	70.00

Write a program that allows a user to enter a trip distance. The output is the ticket price. The distance should be entered as an integer value.
The design of the application's interface is up to you. You must use parallel arrays and range matching, as in the class example from the PowerPoint presentation from Chapter 7.
